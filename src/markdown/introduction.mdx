Mina Bridge is a bridge service that provides access to inter-blockchain liquidity for Mina and brings assets from other chains into the Mina ecosystem. The platform allows users to transfer crypto-assets in and out of the Mina chain to other blockchains.

The first release will support Ethereum to Mina which will offer bridging of

- Ethereum (ETH) to Mina to receive Wrapped Ethereum (wETH)
- Mina (wETH) to Ethereum (ETH)

If you have any questions, take a look at the FAQ section of the bridge. If you need to contact the support team or have further questions, please go to MinaBridgeâ€™s dedicated support channel on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/SJgHK6X9dD)
