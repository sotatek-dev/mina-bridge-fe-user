### **Ethereum to Mina Transfer Example**

**Please note:**

- It can take up to 30 minutes for WETH to be available on Auro once the bridging transaction is confirmed on Metamask
- There are two distinct stages in the process
  - Locking Ethereum on the Eth side
  - Minting WETH on the MIna side
- For a breakdown of [fees](/user-guide#bridging-fee) please see here

You can select by clicking on the token from the list or search by typing the name of the cryptocurrency.
