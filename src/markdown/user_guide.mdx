### **Ethereum (ETH) to Mina (wETH) Transfer Example**

- It can take up to 2 hours for wETH to be available on Auro Wallet once the bridging transaction is confirmed on Metamask. This is to ensure full confidence in transaction finality (See [here](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/mina-protocol/lifecycle-of-a-payment) for further detail).
- There are two distinct stages in the process.
  - Locking ETH on the Ethereum side.
  - Minting wETH on the Mina side.
- For a breakdown of [fees](/user-guide#bridging-fee) please see here.

### 1. Wallet Support

To support an Ethereum (ETH) to Mina (wETH) bridging, Ensure you have Metamask(Download [here](https://metamask.io/download)) & Auro (Download [here](https://www.aurowallet.com/)) installed.

### 2. Connect Wallet

After installing the wallet successfully,you can manage the bridging process via [MinaBridge](/).

- **Step 6**: Metamask will pop up to allow you to sign the locking transaction on Ethereum and review the Ethereum Network fees. If you are happy to proceed, hit “confirm” on Metamask - the transaction will appear on Metamask as processing and then confirmed.

- **Step 7**: After the transaction has been confirmed on Metamask, you will be able to track its progress via the Bridge’s [History Page](/history). This allows you to drill into the source and destination transactions via EtherScan and MinaScan.
