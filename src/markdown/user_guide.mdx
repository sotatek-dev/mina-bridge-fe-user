**Please note:**

- It can take up to 20 minutes for WETH to be available on Auro once the bridging transaction is confirmed on Metamask
- There are two distinct stages in the process
  - Locking Ethereum on the Eth side
  - Minting WETH on the MIna side
- For a breakdown of [fees](/user-guide#bridging-fee) please see here

#### 1. Wallet extension

Ensure you have Metamask installed

#### 2. Connect wallet

After installing the wallet successfully, visit [here.](/)

![Home page](/user-guide/home-full.png)

Click on **Connect to Wallet**.

- Step 1: Click on a specific network (Ethereum), this indicates that Ethereum is their source network for tokens to be bridged.
- Step 2: Choose Wallet (Metamask).
- Step 3: After clicking Choose Wallet, the system will trigger your wallet to Connect Wallet. Click Confirm to Connect to our web3 application.

- Mina Bridge has been connected to the wallet on Metamask with Ethereum network.

- To disconnect from the bridge application, Click on Disconnect Button.
- To change source account, you can do this through Metamask.

#### 3. Bridge

- _**Step 1**: Choose Assets_

![Choose Assets](/user-guide/select-token-390px.png)

The Mina Bridge supports only Ethereum at present though other tokens are planned to be added in the near future; the select asset feature will be more relevant at this stage.

You can select by clicking on the token from the list or search by typing the name of the cryptocurrency.

- _**Step 2**: Choose “From” and “To” network types. The FromNetwork must be the source network, in this case Ethereum:_

![Form Bridge](/user-guide/form-bridge-390px.png)

- **Destination Address:** This is where the receiving address will be input, in this case your Mina Address.

- _**Step 3**: Enter the amount of Ethereum you wish to bridge and click Next._

- _**Step 4**: Review the order details and ensure you have read the terms and conditions of the Bridge. If you are happy to proceed, Click ‘Confirm’._

  ![Confirm popup](/user-guide/confirm-bridge-390px.png)

- _**Step 5**: Metamask will pop up to allow you to sign the locking transaction on Ethereum and review the Ethereum Network fees. If you are happy to proceed, hit “confirm” on Metamask - the transaction will appear on Metamask as processing and then confirmed._

- _**Step 6**: After the transaction has been confirmed, you will be able to track its progress via the Bridge’s history screen. This allows you to drill into the source and destination transactions via EtherScan and MinaScan._

#### 4. History Page

_List of statuses:_

- **ETH Locked**: Your source funds have been locked on Ethereum allowing for minting of WETH on Mina.

- **Minting WETH in Mina network**: You WETH is now being minted on the Mina Network.

- **Success**: Bridging transaction is complete and your WETH is available on Auro.

#### 5. Proof of Asset

[Proof of Asset](/proof-of-asset)

Proof of Asset in Bridge Token Multi-Chain is a mechanism used to ensure that each token created or transferred across different blockchains is backed by a corresponding asset. It helps maintain the integrity and value of the tokens as they move between various blockchain networks.

Here's how proof of asset works in a multi-chain bridge token system:

1. Locking the original asset: When a user wants to transfer tokens from one blockchain to another (e.g., from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain), the bridge system locks the equivalent amount of tokens on the original blockchain. This ensures that the tokens being transferred to the new chain are properly backed and prevents the creation of unbacked tokens.
2. Minting tokens on the new chain: After the original assets are locked on the first blockchain, an equivalent amount of tokens is minted on the new blockchain. These newly minted tokens represent the locked assets from the original chain.
3. Proof of Asset: The system provides proof that the amount of newly minted tokens on the new blockchain is backed by the corresponding assets locked on the original blockchain. This information is usually recorded on the blockchain to ensure transparency and trust.
4. Redeeming (returning assets): When a user wants to transfer the tokens back to the original blockchain, the system will burn the equivalent tokens on the new blockchain and unlock the corresponding assets on the original chain.

For example, if you want to transfer 100 ETH from Ethereum to Mina using a bridge, the system will lock 100 ETH on Ethereum and mint an equivalent amount of 100 WETH (minus fees) on Mina. When you redeem the tokens, the ETH on Mina will be burned, and the 100 ETH (minus fees) on Ethereum will be unlocked for your use.

The proof of asset mechanism ensures a balance and trust between different blockchain networks, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing transparency.
